<p>Project objective and overview:</p>

<p>This project was an undergraduate collaborative group project inspired almost spontaneously by a seemingly passing observation we made about how casually we had been using our language with each other. The casual use of language, including the use of profanity, is commonplace among people who feel more comfortable with each other than they might feel with strangers, or so we thought. This led us to wonder about the extent to which students were cognizant about their (or others') use of language. Ultimately, we had the creative idea to figure out a dollar amount the student body of Willamette would have to owe to a swear jar.</p>

<p>This was a very fun project to end my university career on for my data science major, and I'd like to thank my partner, Dylan Ray, as a lot of the remarks he made that may have been just silly musings turned out to help drive the progress of the project with some creative spins on some of the problems we were having with our data and analysis. I would also like to thank professor and mentor, Dr. Kristen Gore, who was instrumental in keeping us accountable and on track to succeed with valuable insights to develop budding ideas and critical milestones to monitor progress.</p>
