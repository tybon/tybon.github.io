<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>I am engaging some of my time into some projects that involve analyzing data that might yield some insightful things for me to write about. Below is a list of some of my projects.</p>
<p>
At the current moment, the pages below have only been set up structurally, but I plan to have them fleshed out as the projects in progress become more completed and as I have more time to add substance to the pages of projects that have been completed!
